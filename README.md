## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create visualizations data for PyBer a ride-sharing service. It was requested that ride-sharing data by city type was to be used for this analysis. A line graph was used to analyze the data by weeks. We will be addressing any disparities among the city types and three busiess recommendations.
## Results
In the ride-sharing data, we can see that although Rural is the most expensive per ride and driver, it has the least amount of total fares. In figure one, we can see the disparaties of each city type. In figure two, a line graph is used for the visualization of this analysis.

### Total Rides, Drivers, and Fares
When looking at Figure one, we can see that the total rides is greatest for Urban city types followed by suburban and then rural city types. Rural city types had 125 total rides while suburban city types had 625 total rides. Urban city types had a little more than 2.5 times more total rides than suburban city types with 1,625 rides. Rural city types is once again in last place with total drivers. Urban city types has the significally more drivers than both rural and suburban cities. Urban city types has a total of 2,405 total drivers while suburban has 490 drivers followed by rural city types with 78 drivers. Urban city types has almost 5 times more drivers than suburban cities and almost 31 times more drivers than rural cities. Once again looking at the data, we can see that the total fares for rural city types, is much lower than both urban and suburban cities. Rural city types spent a total of $4,237.93 in fares, suburban cities had a total of $19,356.33 in fares, and urban had a total of $39,854.38 in fares.

### Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver
Although rural city types had the lowest total rides, total drivers, and total fare costs, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver was a different story. Rural averages of fare and drivers was higher than both suburban and urban city types. When looking at the data, rural cities cost almost $4 more than suburban cities, and over $10 more than urban city types. When finding the average fare per driver, rural cities was almsot 1.5 times more than suburban city types, and was over three times more than urban city types.

## Summary
Looking at the results that were obtained in this analysis, we can see that there is a great difference between users from rural and urban city types. In order for more users to use PyBer in rural city types, we have developed three buisness ideas to help imporve access in these communities.
 ### Buisness Recommendations 
   1.) PyBer needs to create incentives to be able to reach crowds in rural city types. We can do this by offering discounts for new users. This will encourage people to sign up from rural areas and realize the convenience of PyBer. 
   
   2.) Reward loyal customers. Rewarding loyal customers will influence them to keep on using a service. This will not only help rural customers to use the service more frequently but also increase the use of PyBer in all city types. 
   
   3.) Have promotions or bonuses for drivers. When looking at how many drivers there are in rural city types, one can see how drastically less drivers there are compared to other cities and how much more expensive it is. Usually low supply, high demand, can cause high costs. By encouraging people to sign up to be a driver for PyBer, it could help keep overall costs lower and cause there to be more users in rural city types.
